* Change dictionary in create_dictionary to a Collection to clean up code

* Change old course_ids to new course_id's. How? Use CourseCatalog_REAl.csv. Create a lookup from 
old course_ids to new course_ids by first creating a temporary lookup from old course_ids to course title, and then from course title to new course_ids, and then zip up the two lookups.

Once this lookup is built, change create_dictionary so that, instead of adding the old course_id, it does a lookup in the mapping from old course_id's to new course_id's instead.

Only do this if the SIS doesn't have a translation table for ids themselves

* Test predictions for 2015 based on some enrollment data from SIS
