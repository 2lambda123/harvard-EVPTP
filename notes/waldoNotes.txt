Wrote create_dictionary_new.py, which will convert the new form of .csv received from the SIS group to a dictionary that
is in the same form as that produced by create_dictionary.py. If I wanted to be clever, I could merge the code into
create dictionary (and add a flag or a configuration to determine which of the formats the original csv is in), but
since the format of the dumps are likely to change, I dicided just to write a new program. It does, however, re-use
much of the original program.

In doing this, I found a somewhat simpler way of determining if the dictionary entries have been created, and so went
back and changed create_dictionary.py to use the simpler algorithm.

Added code to make create_dictionary.py idempotent if run on the same csv file with a dictionary that has already added
the contents of that csv. When an existing dictionary is read, a set is created that will keep track of the course-id,
years, and term for the courses in the dictionary. If this combination is found in the csv being read in, it will be
skipped.

Re-factored create_dictionary.py to allow passing in the csv file from which to read the course data, and to append to a
dictionary if one has already been created (by reading in the created file, and then adding the contents of the csv file
to the dictionary). Note that if you append a file that has already been read, it will add the enrollment again; this
should be fixed but right now we should make sure never to run the same file through twice.

Thinking about changing the data for the historical course enrollments so that the course numbers don't vary between
the old, pre-SIS numbers and the new course numbers.

Created a set of files from the mapping from new course numbers to old course numbers (where there is a lot of other
information, as well). This is a csv file in which the first entry is the new course number, and the last entry is
the old course number (so, if l is a line, l[0] = new course number, l[10] = old). From this, I created pickles of
the set of old courses (saved in old_course_set), a set of new course numbers (new_course_set), a dictionary indexed
by old course number with value new course number (old_to_new_dict) and a dictionary indexed by new course number with
value old course number (new_to_old_dict).
